# simple-contact-us-form

This code implements the front-end for a simple Contact Us form. I designed this web form in accordance with best practices for usability, accessibility, and sustainability, as suggested by the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/), the [University of California IT Leadership Council's Electronic Accessibility Committee](https://www.ucop.edu/electronic-accessibility/web-developers/tools-and-testing/guidelines-accessible-surveys-forms.html), and [MightyBytes](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/), respectively. I also tested it with the [NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/).

1. Only vital information is requested.
2. All input fields are labeled and have their required attribute set to "true."
3. Labels and their input fields are visually grouped by setting their background color to contrast with the page's background color.
4. Fields are presented in a single-column layout to make the workflow clearer.
5. Tab order is set to ensure correct tab order.
6. The mouse is automatically set to the first form input field.
7. Sequencing of fields follows the well-known convention of entering one's personal information before one's message.
8. There is no placeholder text. 
9. There are no fancy animations wasting energy.
10. Formatting is tailored for both desktop and mobile platforms.
